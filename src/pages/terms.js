      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        These terms and conditions apply to all services rendered. The first payment is proof of your accptance of these
        terms and conditions. If you have any questions regarding anything in here please contact me so that I can
        answer your question and improve this document. As with most things I have also injected a small measure of
        humor into this because heck, I had to write it so might as well have some fun.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>
        I’ll always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things
        written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something
        goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text.
        I've no desire to trick you into agreeing to something that you might later regret. What I do want is what’s
        best for both parties, now and in the future.

      <h3>So in short</h3>

      <p>You, are hiring me Barbara Melton (“I or Me”) to do one or more of the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Write a blog post</li>
        <li>Ghost writting</li>
        <li>Copywriting</li>
        <li>Advertising copy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.</p>

      <h3>What do both parties agree to?</h3>

      <p>
        You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your
        organisation. You’ll give me the assets and information I tell you I need to complete the project. You’ll do
        this when I ask and provide it in the formats I ask for. You’ll review the work, provide feedback and approval
        in a timely manner, too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also
        agree to stick to the payment schedule set out here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Me: I have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed to. I’ll do it all in a professional and
        timely manner. I’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that I'll maintain the
        confidentiality of everything you give me.
      </p>

      <p>Getting down to the nitty-gritty</p>

      <h3>Text content</h3>

      <p>I write only original content. Research is incorporated as necessary to support your business.</p>

      <h3>Claims of Violations of Copyright, Trademark, Patent or Trade Secret</h3>

      <p>
        I write original content. I will always cite research because it is important to give credit. If I inadvertantly
        violate someone's copyright I will re-write the work at no charge after proof of violation is given.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes and revisions</h3>
      <p>
        I don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. I will do one revision for free. Further revisions will
        be charged at my normal hourly rate with a one hour minimum, billed in 15-minute increments.
      </p>
      <p>Before the project is completed you should review the entire document.</p>

      <h3>Legal stuff</h3>

      <p>
        I’ll carry out my work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably
        qualified person with relevant experience. That said, I can’t guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I
        can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental,
        consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised me of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your liability to me will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be
        liable to me or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental,
        consequential or special damages, even if I’ve advised you of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that
        provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
        any remaining provisions.
      </p>

      <p>Phew.</p>

      <h3>Intellectual property rights</h3>

      <p>
        Just to be clear, “Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright (including
        rights in software) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get up and trade names, internet domain
        names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, database rights, rights in confidential
        information (including know-how) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or
        unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights
        and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the future
        in any part of the world.
      </p>

      <p>Blimey.</p>

      <p>
        I guarantee that all elements of the work I deliver to you are either owned by me or I’ve obtained permission to
        use the work. When I provide text I agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you’re using their
        intellectual property. Provided you’ve paid for the work and that this contract hasn’t been terminated, I’ll
        assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ll own the copy I write. I’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere
        safe as we’re not required to keep a copy. You own all intellectual property rights of text you provided, unless
        someone else owns them.
      </p>

      <h3>Displaying my work</h3>

      <p>
        I love to show off my work, so I reserve the right to display all aspects of my creative work, including copy,
        blog posts, articles in my portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and in books.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment schedule</h3>

      <p>
        I'm sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that I send you
        promptly. As I'm also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment
        schedule unless I agree to a different schedule in advance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Monthly blog post contracts will begin in the following month. All payments will be due on the 1st day of the
        month.
      </p>

      <p>One time copywriting will be billed weekly and on an hourly basis.</p>

      <p>
        Any hourly charges for all miscellaneous work will be billed weekly after the work has been done and is due upon
        receipt.
      </p>

      <p>
        I issue invoices electronically. My payment terms are due upon receipt. All invoices and quotes are in USD and
        payments will be made at the equivalent conversion rate at the date the transfer is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        You agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers of funds. The appropriate bank account
        details will be printed on our electronic invoice. I reserve the right to charge late fees on all overdue
        invoices. The late fee is $50 or 10% of the invoice whichever is greater on any invoice 15 days past due.
      </p>

      <p>
        If any invoice goes over 30 days past due all services will be stopped until the account is brought current.
        That is all services I provide to you. Please do not make me do this.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment Methods</h3>

      <p>
        I accept credit credit cards and paper checks. I use Stripe to process credit cards and to manage my billing.
      </p>

      <p>Paper checks can be mailed to:</p>

      <address>
        1004 South Avenue B <br />
        Denton, TX 76201 <br />
      </address>

      <h3>But where’s all the horrible small print?</h3>

      <p>
        Just like a parking ticket, neither of us can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s
        permission.
      </p>

      <p>
        We both agree that we’ll adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this
        contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
        This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes
        invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.
      </p>

      <p>
        If anything in this changes I do not need to inform you of those changes. It is your responsability to know what
        you're agreeing to.
      </p>

      <p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document.</p>

      <p>Oh and don’t forget those men with big dogs.</p>
