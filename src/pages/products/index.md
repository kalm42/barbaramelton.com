      text: Different sizes are available. Even necklace size! The necklace size works
        in a car as well. Various colors. Most have feathers. Some people
        request one without feathers because of allergies. Handmade pom-poms are
        also available. Reach me at barbara.melton@gmail.com
  heading: What I offer
  description: >
    I make Dream Makers. The purpose of these is as the name implies--to offer
    spiritual aid in making your dreams come true. I make each one, weaving a
    special prayer into it. I trust the Divine Source to match prayer/Dream
    Maker to person. I am also happy to make one for a loved one with your
    special prayer for them woven in. You can reach me at
    barbara.melton@gmail.com
