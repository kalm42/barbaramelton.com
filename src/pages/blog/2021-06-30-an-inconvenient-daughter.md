I was 14. Standing in the kitchen in our home, this year in a small Arkansas town. It was time to cook dinner. Nothing new. Felt like I have been cooking dinner at least once a week since I was born. But really just since I was 10. But this dinner was special. Spaghetti was the entree. But I had been given permission to prepare and serve it anyway I wanted. I was the Cook.

That’s how I saw the word, capital ‘C’. Mom wore her Proud Smile, the one she offered when I was completing some milestone, some epic moment of childhood. I have always wondered at her silence in these moments. She usually cannot stop herself from narrating. She reads street signs as we pass them, she explains cartoons and movies. She tells Little Brother and I that she loves us, then explains all the things she does for us so we understand just how big her love is. The only moments she chooses not to narrate and explain are the big ones. Those are met with silence.

There were moments that, in hindsight, were big, lit with flashing neon: Life Lesson Ahead. I couldn’t always understand during the moment just how important it was. Maybe it’s like that for everyone. Maybe not.

Even when I learned to recognize that an event was symbolically bigger than it seemed, I couldn’t always get the point of it all. I always felt an eager expectation from Mom, a boundless hope that I would recognize a profound moment and react accordingly. Like a good, 10-Kleenex Hallmark movie, I would finally hear her silence for the wisdom and love packed message it was. I would finally turn to her in wonder, hugging her tight as I thanked her over and over for helping me become a strong woman just like her. But I almost always let her down. She tried explaining how important it was for me not only to recognize the important times but also to thank the person providing them. She was, after all, going out of her way to help me grow from a girl to a woman.

“Aurora, you’re getting older. You’ll have your own family one day. Tonight you are the Cook. You decide.”

“Mom, really? I get to choose?”

Mom and Stepdad valued obedience above all. Offering a free hand with the menu was unheard of. Her words felt like a trap. But I shoved that thought away. I wanted to believe her, wanted to believe that I would be allowed to choose—and not be punished for choosing wrong. I wanted to let my excitement grow. And I could tell by looking at her expression that it was necessary for me to show the excitement I was afraid to feel.

My thoughts stopped racing, excitement halted when I heard Mom say, “Yes, Aurora D. Of course, you get to choose. I just told you: You are the Cook. Aren’t you listening? Okay. We’re having spaghetti with French bread. Be sure to make the salad dressing your Dad likes. But you don’t have to put it on the salad like usual. Like I said. You can choose.”

Mom beamed with pride. The Proud Smile let me know this was one of those milestone moments. I was supposed to show excitement. But I was confused. What was I choosing? She just rolled out the entire menu. Because this was one of those “next steps” to whatever being a “woman” was, I knew it was dangerous to ask questions. Asking meant I did not know. And I was supposed to know.

“Mom, this is cool! So I get to choose how the table looks, right?”

I made sure to look and sound excited. Mom always had clear ideas about how I was supposed to react. I was often a disappointment, showing the wrong emotion at the wrong time. Feeling confused and frustrated but looking and sounding excited, I watched Mom.

“Yes! You can decorate the table anyway you want. And you can choose how to serve the dinner.”

I grinned with happiness. Mom’s response let me know I’d gotten everything right. And there was something I got to choose. It didn’t matter that cooking an extra dinner was nothing to be happy about in my opinion. It didn’t matter that even in the 1980s the definition of “woman” hadn’t changed for Mom from what she had been taught. Mom expected happiness and excitement at the thought of cooking dinner for the family. After all, a good woman lives to serve her family.

I chose to focus on what I thought of as a win. I had just been given permission to serve spaghetti in what I was sure was the “correct” way: Pasta with sauce spooned over it.

Mom always had the sauce simmering away. When the pasta was done, she drained it and then dumped it into the sauce. She stirred it all together. Sometimes she added shredded cheddar cheese.

Like most 14 year olds, I was sure Mom was doing a lot of things wrong, including making spaghetti. Every ad I saw on TV showed pasta, steaming and ready. Then came the sauce, spooned invitingly over the pasta. A sprinkle of Parmesan was a perfect finishing touch. Finally, I had the chance to serve spaghetti the right way like they did on TV. I was excited and happy.

Stepdad joined us and saw the beautiful table. Bowls of salad at each of our four settings. Each plate held what I thought was a beautiful helping of spaghetti: pasta with sauce spooned over. Parmesan cheese was there on the table, next to the salt and pepper. The bowl of French bread, fresh from the oven, sat next to the bowl of steamed broccoli. I looked up proud and expectant of praise, at least a smile.

In the moment when I had allowed myself to be proud of the meal I had prepared and the way I presented it, the world had changed. Mom’s Proud Smile had frozen on her face, chipping into rage like ice-stones. Little Brother stared at his plate. Quiet. He glanced at me through his eyelashes. Then I looked at Stepdad. He was unhappy, racing toward livid.

His head had been in his hands, elbows propped on the table. I thought he was ready to say grace. I was wrong. As his head raised, I saw his rage, felt the same freezing fear.

He glared at Mom as he stood from the table, throwing his napkin on top of his plate, like my beautiful meal was trash.

He began in almost a whisper. But within a few words, he was bellowing like a wild beast: “Woman, how the fuck could you let this happen? I have told you what it was like in there! To think I could eat this shit. How dare you!”

Mom pleaded, “Now Darling. This is Aurora D’s dinner. We agreed she could do it her way. We agreed.”

“Yeah, we agreed the bitch could do it her way. But you know better! I will not eat this shit! This will never be served this way again. Ever!”

And he stormed off.

Mom scooted her chair away from the table as she moved to follow him. I sat still in my chair. Tears running down my face. My beautiful dinner made ugly.

Ever in search of her perfect family, Mom explained just how my beautiful dinner had made my stepfather feel bad. She reminded me how important it was not to be selfish, how wrong it was to put my feelings ahead of others’. Near the end of her small speech, she began to shake. I feared it was rage at me.

“Aurora D, they made him eat spaghetti like this when he was sent away. You know, in Atascadero. Seeing it like this makes him feel bad because it reminds him of that time. You must understand that is hurtful to him. I’ve told you before how to cook spaghetti. I cannot believe you would do such a thoughtless, cruel thing to your Dad! Maybe he shouldn’t have yelled. But really, Aurora D, this was a rude, hateful act!”

And then she left to comfort her husband.

I sat still. Frozen with rage and fear and embarrassment and humiliation and hate and love and fear.

My thoughts ran like gerbils in my head, “Why does she tell me I can choose when she doesn’t mean it? I can hear her in there telling him that she told me not to, but that I didn’t listen. She wants me to feel bad for him! Why does no one feel bad for me? I’m the one he tried to rape when I was 6. It was my 4 year-old body he probed with his sweaty hands. I was the 4 year old he punished for not being “ladylike.” I was the one he hurt. He went to Atascadero because he hurt me over and over and over. They blame me. It’s my fault—they tell me all the time. No one talks about how she sent me away, too. And oh dear Lord. It was so awful where she sent me. And to make me keep calling him “Dad” when she promised me I wouldn’t have to! He’s a fucking liar, pretending like he doesn’t still try to spy on me in the bathroom, pretending like he doesn’t still say nasty things to me, sometimes even when Mom is in the room! He just stopped touching me two years ago! Mom! Asking like she wants to know if he’s still trying to rape me every damn chance he gets. She doesn’t want to know. She just wants her perfect fucking family. No matter the cost. I think the thing she hates most about me is that I keep fucking up her perfect family.”

Little Brother, now that it was just us, started eating. He looked at me and said it was good. I said thanks. And we pretended for the millionth time that everything was fine. We pretended like it wasn’t weird to eat dinner while Mom and Stepdad screamed at each other in their bedroom. We knew there would be fresh hell for us if we didn’t eat. No need to add punishment for being wasteful to our list.

But the knot of rage that had been building in me since I was two or three years old grew. I could hear the argument raging in their bedroom. I’m fairly certain the neighbors could hear. Mom was sure I’d apologize. She was promising that I would, that never again would any dish be served that made him remember his time in “that awful place.”

Then it was hours later and she was in my bedroom, sitting next to me on my bed, holding my hand gently in hers as she explained what must be done.

“Aurora, you must understand how awful it was for him in that place. It was very hard for him in there. Maybe you can’t imagine how awful it was for him to be around rapists and other men like that. And for you to make spaghetti like that. Well, it just reminded him too much of that place and that time. I’m sure you didn’t mean to do it on purpose. But he is hurt. He didn’t mean to yell. It’s just that he was so hurt and shocked. So I think you should talk to him.”

For the first time, I couldn’t just fall in line with what the adults thought was best.

“No, I won’t, Mom. Why is it okay for him to be rude and mean to me? It is not my fault he went to that place. I am the one he hurt.”

Mom no longer held my hand. She slid hers away, used it to smooth the wrinkles out of the sheet. The silence lengthened as she finished smoothing the sheet then stood, looking down at me.

“I see.”

And she left the room.

By the third day, I was comfortable not speaking to Stepdad. I was pretty sure I could be comfortable with it for the rest of my life.

By the third day, Mom was frantic. Stepdad was more and more upset, demanding that Mom fix the problem with her bitch, slut daughter. Mom promised to fix everything and hushed him. As always, she didn’t want me to hear myself called “slut.” She never defended me, no “how dare you” kind of responses. Always just pleading for Stepdad to say the word quietly. Like she agreed with him and was just too sad for me to hear it. I never told her how I snuck her dictionary into my bedroom and looked up the definition of “slut” when I was 11. I didn’t match the definition. It hurt more knowing what the word meant.

It was a Sunday when I was forced to apologize. We were eating brunch, all in our jammies and bathrobes.

Mom announced, “We will have no more of this. We are a Family. We must talk with each other. Let’s go into the living room so Aurora can apologize.”

My refusal died before it reached my lips. Mom’s eyes were the emerald green that signified rage. She was vibrating with rage. And I knew I was beaten. I knew from experience that if pushed, a verbal beating would commence. She would not stop telling me what a worthless, lazy, weak, cowardly daughter I was. She would not stop telling me how disappointed she was, how no matter what she experienced as a child, she always fought back because she was strong. She was always so ashamed of having such a weak daughter.

Once she began a verbal beating, she stopped only when I was a sobbing mess, bowed in half, barely human. When I collapsed in on myself, she heaved a sigh of release—and her silence cued me. As always. I had to apologize to her for being all the things she said I was. Not completing this punishment with my groveling yet sincere apology was not an option. She required it. She had explained to me that not apologizing meant I had not learned my lesson. It was her duty to be sure I learned my lesson.

And I lived with the constant fear she would send me back to Dad. No one spoke of how she sent me away to live with Dad the same time Stepdad was sentenced to Atascadero. No one talked about how my sentence was three years. Stepdad was sentenced to a couple years in Atascadero for repeatedly sexually abusing me, for attempting to rape me.

She sent me to live with my father, told me it was so my Stepmom could teach me how to be a lady. But even at seven I knew the truth: I had ruined her perfect family by being sexually molested. I was no longer pure enough to be her Baby Girl. Even though I was only 6 when Stepdad was arrested, Mom was forever disappointed in me. I had not physically fought him off, which meant I was weak. In her eyes I was no longer the pure daughter. I had ruined her perfect family. So she sent me away.

Life was much more dangerous with my dad. Violence was added to the mix of sexual molestation, attempted rapes, verbal, and emotional abuse. It was while living with Dad that I first heard myself referred to as a slut. Stepmom screamed the word when she sent him to my bed.

“Go sleep with your slut of a daughter. She knows how to keep you warm.”

I was 7. There will never be an answer to why Dad obeyed Stepmom instead of beating her for speaking back. All I knew was that I would not survive if Mom sent me back to Dad. I was beaten into submission, again.

I looked at her and whispered the beginning of my groveling apology to her, “Okay, I’ll talk to him.”

But uttering the apology aloud wasn’t good enough. I was the last person to enter the living room. Mom and Stepdad were seated in their respective recliners. Little Brother was perched uncomfortably on the couch.

“Aurora, go ahead and sit on your Dad’s lap. We are going to heal this family. We ARE a family.“

I stopped in front of her. Looked at her, crying, my eyes pleading with her not to make me sit on his lap. She smiled her “don’t ever fuck with me” smile. She was the Ice Princess, and there was no talking with her. She pointed to Stepdad.

My punishment for daring to defy her was at hand. She knew humiliating me was an effective way to shut my mouth. Having experienced many moments of humiliation, I must confess sitting on his lap, dressed in nothing but jammies and a robe, is still near the top of the list. He was dressed in his silk robe, and I hoped he at least wore underwear.

In a tone colder than ice, she said, “Have a seat, Aurora Daphne. You are going to talk. You know what to say. Do it.”

I know I crossed the room, sat on Stepdad’s lap, looked at his smiling, triumphant face. I know I apologized for hurting his feelings. I know he apologized for me not understanding how rude and insensitive I had been. I remember it happening. But I do not remember feeling it. I watched it happen from outside of myself. I imagined me, the particles that made me, becoming tinier like a small hard nugget. I imagined that nugget burying itself deeper, trying to hide from this love that wounds and kills. My body sat on his lap. My voice said the lines Mom had given me. My soul hid, trying to survive.

Mom was thrilled as she said, “Aurora D, give your Dad a kiss on his cheek. That is the perfect way to end this little spat.”

My lips dutifully kissed Stepdad’s cheek. I saw myself do it. And I hated her.

The Ice Princess smiled at her victory.
