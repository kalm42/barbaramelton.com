## Guest Post Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to BarbaraMelton.com! The site is here to celebrate a love of writing and storytelling. One of the most important things we can do to celebrate the art of a well-turned phrase, a well-written story is with occasional Guest Posts.

With that in mind, here are some guidelines and recommendations for each piece of content that you submit.

## Genres accepted

In general, we accept guest content which falls under the following genres:

* Personal essays (2,000 word limit)
* Poems (75 lines or less)
* Short stories (2,000 word limit)
* Flash fiction
* Blog post (1,000-1,500 words)

While brainstorming what to write about, ask yourself these questions:

* Will this topic be relevant to the BarbaraMelton.com audience?
* Will this post offer solutions that don’t require the purchase of my product?
* Am I qualified to write about this topic?
* What insight can I bring to this topic that nobody else can?

When in doubt, get in touch with me (Barb) via BarbaraMelton.com. I’m the one you’ll work with.

Note: Our readers are a diverse group of intelligent, creative, thoughtful, hardworking, humorous people. Do you have something to share with such a group? Topics of interest are vast.

## Guest Post Content Tips

The guiding light behind our hosting of Guest Posts is to share content that’s original, educational, engaging, and entertaining--not product-focused or promotional.

Use a Guest Post to showcase your expertise with potential new customers. If people find your content valuable, they’ll research you all on their own.

Break up your content, so it’s easy to read. Of course, if you wish, include headings, subheadings, or other visual elements. Because BarbaraMelton.com focuses on the art of writing, photos (jpeg or png) are recommended in a limited way. Choose the best one to use.

Write in a natural, conversational tone. We want to share your original content, show off your unique voice. Please note: if your guest post was a movie, the highest rating should be PG-13.

All content MUST BE ORIGINAL. We do not accept duplicate or syndicated content as guest posts. If your post has appeared anywhere else on the web, do not submit it. If you quote other content, link to it.

Always name your sources. We understand you’re an expert, but the audience might not be so sure. If you’re going to drop some stats (ie: “open rates jumped 55 percent overnight”), link back to the original source.

Talk about your real-world experience. Talk about mistakes you’ve made, plans you’ve built, and strategies you’ve executed. Draw on your own personal experience to speak authoritatively about what you know.

## Other Things to Include in Your Guest Post

* Cite your sources! Yep, just stated this above. It is important enough to warrant repeating.
* Outbound Links. Does somebody else have a great point of view on a topic? Want to make sure people know a certain definition of a word or concept? Link to it. Make sure these links are to authoritative sites. Only link to your site if it’s a highly relevant blog post. (NOTE: Please keep in mind BarbaraMelton.com’s love of diversity. Do not link to sites that promote hatred, prejudice, and/or discrimination against any group.)
* Lists and Bullets. We’re fans. Readers are fans. Most people skim articles until they find the value. Bullet points make this easy.
* Actionable Takeaways. Recap the takeaways of your article as bullet points at the end of your post.

NOTE: *BarbaraMelton.com reserves full editorial control and may edit or tweak submissions as we see fit. These tweaks include anything from removing too much self-promotion, to optimizing for SEO, edits both small and large, and more.

## Guest Post Logistics

* First, we’ll collaborate and agree on a topic and title. Don’t start writing until we’ve done this!
* Once we’ve agreed on the topic, give me a deadline for when you expect to submit the article for us to review.
* After you’ve written your draft, send it to me (Barb) as a Google Doc. Use these sharing settings:
* * On – Anyone with the link;
  * Access – Can edit.
* I’ll make edits in this Doc, so make a copy if you’d like to keep an original version of your writing.
* Send a short, couple sentence bio. This can include a link to your LinkedIn profile and/or your website.
* I’ll let you know when the post is scheduled to go live.

## Guest Post Promotion

Please feel free to promote your post through your social media, newsletter, or link to it from your blog.

You can even include a snippet of the post on your blog, with a link back to the original content on our site (this is important so that we both avoid duplicate content penalties).
