The road to Mamaw’s house was a dirt one—graded, which meant it was a city road because county roads are paved. Mom said it was a good road, not too many bumps and it was practically straight, only a couple of easy curves. We didn’t want folks thinking we were rude Californians, so we drove slowly. I’m not sure what Mom was worried about, though. The air was so heavy that it weighed the dust down like a playground bully. Nothing stirred—not even insects could be heard.

I’d heard about humidity, and I’d lived in the South before. But I sure didn’t remember being able to see the air—maybe it was because I’d been younger when I’d lived in Texas and Missouri, or maybe I’d forgotten what humidity can do to a person. I told myself I’d never forget the feeling of pushing myself through sludge just to take a few steps, of breathing in water, of being wet all the time. I felt like I’d just stepped from the shower, but I wasn’t fresh. It was like I’d showered in pudding.

“Suzy, it won’t help a damn thing for you to keep griping about how hot it is! Why don’t you look around you at all the beauty. I swear you’d miss an elephant you’re so busy complaining!”

The edge on Mom’s voice was serious. She’d sliced right through the thickness, her words slamming into my ears. I knew she was miserable, too. She was sweating, and Mom never sweat. While I didn’t like it, I shut up.

She was right. We’d left California in a drought—everything brown except the pine trees and even those looked droopy. Here in Slapstone, Arkansas everything was green except the bushes next to the road—they had been conquered by the dust.

We were going to visit Mamaw. I’m still not real clear on how we’re related to her. I think she was married to my great-grandpa. But maybe not. We hadn’t seen her in ten years. I’d been a baby last time she’d seen me. Mom said that Mamaw had cancer so us kids probably wouldn’t get to see her.

I was glad because I imagined a shriveled, old woman barely making a dent in the feather bed. I didn’t want to have to hug someone so close to being a corpse. I didn’t say anything about this to Mom because I knew a series of lectures would follow. She’d remind me of our belief in God and how I shouldn’t be afraid of death.

She’d forget the stories she told me about taking dead people to the morgue when she worked at the hospital in southern California, the scary movies I watched with my aunt, and the fact that at fourteen I just was not ready to think about death. I’d also be told, again, the stories of her visits to Mamaw’s.

That’s how I knew Mamaw had a feather bed. That was one of Mom’s favorite stories. She told me lots of times that we had visited Mamaw when I was a baby. Mom, Mamaw, and I slept together in the feather bed, made by Mamaw and stuffed with feathers from her own geese. Mamaw told everybody in town she’d slept between her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter.

Mom always said, “I was so embarrassed! You must remember, I was only eighteen years old, and the thought of everyone knowing I’d slept with my grandmother…well, it was awful. I kept telling Mamaw to quit telling everybody. But she just laughed.”

Then Mom laughed, every time, and said, “Oh, the silly things that embarrass us when we’re young!”

All of Mom’s stories have morals, and she just has to tell me what they are in case I don’t get it. I think she used to be Aesop, for Chrissakes!

I began to think Mom had finally gotten lost. We’d been driving for ages.

I figured I’d been quiet long enough for her to forget I’d been complaining, so I asked, “Mom, how come Mamaw lives so far out of town? If she’s sick, shouldn’t she be closer to town so somebody could take care of her?”

“Mamaw wants to stay in her own home. After all, she’s lived there for most of her ninety years. Besides, she’s not alone—Hubert lives with her.”

“Who’s Hubert?”

“Hubert’s one of Mamaw’s sons.”

My little brother giggled and sang, “Hubert! Hubert! Hubert!”

He wasn’t quite ten, and he thought everything was funny. Especially if laughing bothered me or a grown-up.

Mom, of course, told him it wasn’t nice to make fun of a person’s name, but I thought, “Well, if that isn’t a name begging to be made fun of, then I don’t know what is! This cinches it! I’m related to HICKS! Nobody I’ve ever met is actually named Hubert. It sounds like a name in an ancient book. Hubert… Wonder what a Hubert looks like. He’s probably as old as dirt, like Mamaw. But if he’s Mamaw’s son, he can’t be. Then again, all the women in our family had babies so young. And Mom just said Mamaw was ninety! So if she had Hubert when she was a teen—well, yeah. He could be old as dirt.”

My thoughts were interrupted with Mom’s gleeful, “We’re here!”

I looked at Mom. She was grinning like a cheerleader. I thought she was going to break the door she was so excited. She was waving, so I turned to see who or what she was waving at cause sometimes Mom gets so excited she starts to wave before anyone’s there.

There was a wooden house with a porch all across the front. I couldn’t see anything but the front of the house, which seemed planted in the midst of skinny Arkansas trees. The house wasn’t painted, and there was no front lawn—just a few scattered plants. I think they were wild—they didn’t look like they’d been planted on purpose. There were two wooden rocking chairs on the porch and a couple of plotted flowers, the only spots of color. I guessed looking at the house that it was what people called “weathered.” Then a man appeared at the side.

He came from nowhere like Merlin. Though there was no tree or shrub or anything that he was hiding behind, I felt like he was peeking at us. He stood still as a mannequin—then he saw Mom. A smile spread across his face like a door opening, and he waved. He took a few steps toward us and stopped.

Mom was running toward him, so he waited. She gave him a big hug, telling him it was so good to see him. I was standing behind Mom, so I saw Hubert’s face. He didn’t look as old as dirt. I knew that he was older than Mom by probably a lot, but he looked younger and older at the same time. He didn’t have any wrinkles. His skin was pale tan, not like he’d been sunning himself, more like it was his natural color. His eyes, though, were what made him seem older.

They weren’t pain-filled, but they looked like he knew Life on a first name basis, and Life was a right good man who looked you in the eye when he shook your hand. Life, a tall man with calloused hands that felt soft when they touched you, played checkers with angels in a general store. His laughter embraced you like good music, watermelon, and the delicate scent of meadow flowers. His word was his bond, as Grandpa used to say. Life gave you a fair deal, but he didn’t short change himself, taking his due rewards in every transaction. Life knew your work was important. But friends and loved ones were necessary—they were the gravy that made biscuits heavenly. And his presence made Hubert smile.

I’d never seen a man smile like Hubert. I’d never seen anyone smile like that. The smile came quickly to Hubert’s face, but I never saw it start. I felt like Hubert had been smiling all along, like my smudged sunglasses had blocked my vision. The smile never grew into a grin—it widened, and soon his face glowed like a harvest moon. As I looked at Hubert, I thought of those pictures of Jesus and the Saints and halos in the family Bible. And I thought I’d see angels, too. In fact, I look around.

I remembered Pastor and Mrs. Hambly. They looked Biblical, too. And sometimes when I looked at them, they had angels sitting on their shoulders. The angels, small and cherubic, always surprised me. I think they made themselves small so as not to scare me. Their eyes were like Hubert’s.

Hubert was small and slender, no more than five foot eight. He wasn’t skinny. He looked healthy, but there wasn’t any extra on him. Most of the men in my family are big guys with extra on them. They give you handshakes with their hugs so you get shook all over like jello. And you know you have been greeted. But Hubert let himself be enfolded in Mom’s arms, and he didn’t look insulted. His neat, brown hair looked thin—but no scalp showed through—and didn’t get mussed by Mom’s enthusiastic hug. His almost black eyes shone like a flashlight was behind them.

Mom finally let him go to hold him away from her and get a good look like she did children. Then she motioned us over and introduced us to Hubert.

“Hubert, this is Suzy and James. Hasn’t she grown since you last saw her?”

Like probably every kid I tolerate the oh-you’ve-grown-so speeches from adults I haven’t seen since I was a baby. I guess they don’t know what else to say. I hate most the ones who ask “Do you remember me,” as if I’m going to remember people I met when I was six months old!

But Hubert didn’t say anything like that. He quietly said, “She’s growin into a real purty girl there Willa,” and he smiled again.

I thought he’d whispered, but it was louder than a whisper. Hubert’s voice came like a gentle wind over water. It made me still so I wouldn’t miss anything.

I’d heard Southern accents before. But I’d never heard a man speak so softly. Hubert’s words floated like feathers. My relatives are big talkers. The men speak as heartily as they hug-shake. The women are more soft-spoken, but they can talk. If talking were an Olympic sport, my family would win the Gold—with no effort at all. Visiting relatives we haven’t seen for awhile becomes a marathon of talking, usually all night, and drinking gallons of coffee, which means that some conversations take place loudly because whoever’s in the bathroom just holds up their end of things by yelling from the throne.

Many times Mom’s the one yelling because as Uncle Ray says, “Willa’s sat on that damn throne so much it don’t cotton to no one else’s ass!”

“Raymond Eugene! I heard that!”

“Well, hurry up then. It’s your turn, and we’re all tired a waitin! This game woulda been done damn thirty minutes ago if your bladder was bigger than a BB!”

“Ha!Ha! Very funny! You know good and well you’ve missed playin cards with us! I’m just tryin to make this happy occasion last longer. You oughta thank me!”

Uncle Ray laughed like an exclamation point in an old cartoon.

But Hubert didn’t do that. And he didn’t hug us. He quietly shook our hands. I was all prepared to be hugged along with the handshake, but Hubert moved no closer to me. He did the same with my brother. Hubert’s grip was firm, but I didn’t feel like my hand was a sponge he was wringing all water from. I figured he was saving that for my little brother—I hoped not because James was too skinny. I was almost always afraid James might get hurt cause he was just so skinny. But Hubert shook James’ hand the same way. And it made him stand tall like he’d just shook hands with an important gentleman. Hubert was so quiet me and James almost whispered our nice-to-meet-you’s.

I turned and whispered to James, “He sure doesn’t act like a Hubert, does he?”

When I turned back, Hubert was gone. We’d only been a couple of feet from him. There were no dry twigs and things on the ground—that yard looked like it had been swept clean with a broom. But Hubert made no noise when he left, like a fish in the river—except Hubert seemed not to have made a movement at all, not a ripple. He must have moved because he was gone, completely gone. But I’d seen him out the corner of my eye when I was talking to James. He was there, then he wasn’t. James’ eyes were real big. He was convinced Hubert was a magician, and he wanted to know how he did it. James and I looked at each other, shrugged, and went to wait in the car while Mom chatted with Mamaw.

Mamaw told Mom to sit with her on the feather bed. “It puts me in mind of when y’all was last here.”

“Mamaw, I wish we could’ve visited more often. I’ve missed you so!”

“Willa Mae, y’all’ve been in my prayers ever day. I only wish I could of seed yor little girl growin up. I bet she’s a good girl. I wish I could’ve held yor boy when he was a wee babe.”

“Yes, Mamaw she is. Sometimes she’s ornery, but she doesn’t give us too much trouble. My son is a busy boy. But I love my kids even when they get in trouble. I remember you told me I would. You were right.”

Mamaw’s pain medication made more conversation impossible. She told Mom the cancer hurt more than childbirth. Mom said Mamaw cried as she fell asleep. Mom cried when she told me, and I wondered if Mamaw cried because of the pain or because of the lost time.

We were about half way back to town when Mom finally asked, “What’s wrong with you kids? You haven’t said anything for more than fifteen miles. You ok?”

We looked at each other and silently agreed that I should answer. “Mom, we were wondering how Hubert does that.”

“Does what?”

“How does he move without making noise? How come he doesn’t talk? Is something wrong with him?”

Mom laughed, so much so we had to pull over because she couldn’t see the road any more. Mom’s eyes close when she’s real tickled about something.

“Mom! Why are you laughing at us,” I asked. I hated it when she thought my questions were funny. They were serious to me.

“Oh honey. I’m not laughing at you,” she said giggling.

I hated that, too. I always waited for her to follow it up with “I’m laughing near you!” I think she thought it, just didn’t say it.

“Mom!”

“Suzy,” she said, taking a deep breath, “there’s nothing wrong with Hubert. I don’t know what you mean about him making no noise. Maybe it’s because he’s lived there all his life. He’s become part of the place.”

Mom explained how Hubert had been born at home, had never been away from the farm. I imagined him as a little boy, talking to the trees. Maybe I thought about that because I used to talk to the trees—sometimes they answered me. I think they answered Hubert, too. He’d been on the farm so many years I think the soil spoke to him, telling him what to plant and agreeing to keep weeds and bugs to a minimum. Hubert’s crops were “disgustingly healthy,” as I heard some farmers say. There was awe in their voices. They couldn’t understand how Hubert did it. When the other farmers asked him what his secret was, Hubert smiled like Mona Lisa and told them he just planted and watered, just the same as everybody.

“But Mom, he didn’t talk to us. Everybody talks.”

I knew better than to say our relatives talk a lot. I didn’t want Mom to think I was insulting our family and get mad.

“Well, Hubert’s what some folks would call a Mama’s Boy. He’s not. It’s just that he’s the one who stayed to look after Mamaw when all the others got married and left. It’s usually the daughter that stays, so when a son stays, people call him a Mama’s Boy.”

“You mean Hubert didn’t want to get married? Couldn’t he have married and lived with Mamaw anyway,” I asked.

“Oh, Hubert’s always been shy. He just never liked talking to folks, that’s all. I don’t think he ever had a girl—least ways, I never heard talk of him and any girl.”

“Oh,” was all I could muster after such news.

It was unbelievable that one of my relatives was shy. I knew shy kids, but I didn’t know adults were shy. I thought shyness was something you grew out of like dolls and toy trucks. And I couldn’t imagine him never having a girlfriend. It just seemed too lonely.

It didn’t seem like anything was wrong with Hubert. He wasn’t dimwitted. After all, he was the one who did the taxes, argued with the city, and took care of Mamaw. It took lots of work because Hubert and Mamaw’s house didn’t have electricity or indoor plumbing. The city had tried to get Hubert to hook up to city water and sewer.

He told Mom, “Why should I pay the city to dig up my land, put in pipes, and pay them for water? I got my own well full of good water.”

As my cousin Shorty explained, Hubert didn’t say it like he was angry—he sounded amazed like a kid who’d seen Santa. He’d been drawing water from the well his entire life. It was a system that still worked. He shook his head at the idea he should pay the city for water when he had his own. He thought it was greedy to sign up for more water—he had enough.

I think if Hubert had been more of a talker, he’d have said, “It’s that kind a greediness that’ll be the ruination of the country.”

Our cousin Julie Ann lived down the road from Hubert and Mamaw. She and her husband Henry had a baby boy, Timmy. Hubert loved Timmy. Julie Ann would hold Timmy, and Hubert would lean over her shoulder and let the baby hold onto one of his fingers. He always smiled at the baby, but he never did any of that baby-talking that most grown-ups do to babies.

Timmy was a crying baby—cried about everything. Except when Hubert was around. I think he liked Hubert’s quietness—maybe Timmy could see the angels around Hubert. I’m sure they were there because I’ve never seen such a halo around anyone—not even Preacher Halby.

Julie Ann and Henry were real proud of their home, which lay a few acres down the road from Mamaw’s. Julie Ann told me they wouldn’t have been able to buy it without Hubert’s help. They needed $5,000 for the down payment on the land.

She said, “We knew Hubert was the only one in the family who could loan that kind of money. Mama and Daddy don’t have it.”

Hubert had that kind of money! I couldn’t believe it. He didn’t go to work anywhere, probably couldn’t talk enough to go to an interview, and I’m pretty sure he didn’t own any shoes. How could he have that kind of money? I had to know.

“Julie Ann, why did y’all think Hubert would have that much money? He doesn’t work, does he, at a regular job?”

Julie Ann giggled. “Suzy, Hubert’s a farmer! Didn’t you know, honey? He’s loaded! When Henry and I went to talk to him, he listened and said he’d have to think on it overnight.”

Henry jumped in, “He just wanted to wait for dark so nobody’d see where he went to dig his money up. Nobody knows exactly where Hubert buries his money.”

“Oh! Henry, you don’t know that Hubert buries his money in Mason jars! That’s an old story! Don’t be tellin Suzy such tales.”

Henry wasn’t convinced. “Hmph! Doesn’t bury it my ass!” He turned to me and said, “Hubert brought us $5,000 in cash the next morning. Now you tell me, when did he have time to go to the bank? He never left the farm all day, and he got here with the cash before 8:00 a.m.—the banks don’t open til 9.”

Timmy began to cry, so Julie Ann and Henry left the room. I was glad because I didn’t want to have to say anything. Of course, I’d read in books about old moonshiners who buried their money in Mason jars, but to think I had a relative, a rich relative, who buried money was too much for me. I pictured Hubert walking out to his secret place with a shovel in one hand and a lantern high in the other. I wondered if he had his money buried all in one place. After all, he and Mamaw had twenty acres, plenty of places to bury money. He would have waited for the moon to set so no one could see him. He would have to know the way by heart because kerosene lanterns don’t give out much light. I asked Mom about it.

“Well, Hubert lived through the last of the Depression, so he doesn’t trust banks. When they closed, lots of people lost everything. He told me once if the banks could close like that once, they could again. He said he was not going to be anybody’s fool—his money was just fine.”

“But, Mom, doesn’t he want to earn interest. Julie Ann said he’s loaded. He could be even richer if he put it in the bank and got interest.”

Mom smiled and for once didn’t laugh when she answered. “Hubert says he’s got enough money, that he doesn’t need some big bank that doesn’t even know him paying him money so they can say they’ve got his. Hubert doesn’t trust banks, but I think he’d feel bad getting interest money from them. It’d be like money he didn’t earn.”

That was too weird for me. Everybody knew getting interest from the bank was good because they used your money to help the community grow. The teacher had taught us about it, and it was in the social studies book. I thought maybe Hubert just didn’t know that.

But Mom said, “Oh Hubert knows all that. But he figures if you need a loan, you should go to your family. If no one has the money, it probably means you shouldn’t buy whatever it is you’re trying to buy. Just save up for it. That was the way things were done when Hubert was a young man.”

It was one more thing I didn’t understand about Hubert. But it did fit him. He and Mamaw still used the outhouse and still bathed in a big metal tub.

In 1974, Mamaw told Hubert, “Hubert, you go to that store in town and buy some of that toi-let paper. Julie Ann’s pregnant now, and that old catalog is just too rough for her.”

Julie Ann said that after she had Timmy they quit buying the toi-let paper, so she always brought a roll with her when she came to visit. She said, “Sears and Roebuck may not hurt to look at, but it’s awful rough on my soft spots!”

It made sense that a man who refused indoor plumbing and electricity, wiped his butt with the pages of a wish book, and bathed in a wash tub would see no use for banks. Hubert also had no modern equipment. He tilled the soil with a mule drawn plow, Hubert bringing up the rear, so to speak. In his straw hat, t-shirt, and jeans, he wrapped the reins around his upper arms, where they joined to his shoulders, and talked softly to the mule and plowed his fields. Hubert’s mule was never stubborn—I think it saw the angels like Timmy did.

Hubert grew squash, cucumbers, watermelon, corn, beets, potatoes, yams, even peanuts. What he didn’t sell, he put up, which means he canned vegetables and made jelly. He even made peanut butter! I’d never seen a man do such a thing! I thought it was a rule that men harvested and women preserved. Folks knew Hubert did this “woman’s work,” and it made some sure Hubert was a Mama’s Boy.

Hubert did his farming barefooted. He said, “I tried wearin them work boots, ordered me a pair from the catalog. But they shor did wear out right fast! Didn’t see any rhyme or reason to waste more money on another pair of em.”

His feet were always clean, except at watering time. But the soles must have been, as Mom said, “tougher than bull-hide leather” because he could walk across hot ground without hopping—he could walk right through a sticker patch without getting any in him. I used to think that the land loved him and just didn’t want to hurt him. Mom was right—he was part of the place. He tended the farm like a new mother, and the land, like a stray brought in from the cold, never hurt him.

Since Mamaw had passed away, Hubert lived by himself, but I don’t think he felt lonely. He sang while he plowed, sowed, and reaped. He read some in the evening, although I think he just liked holding the book because most often it rested in his lap while he gazed like a seer at the night sky.

All the grown-ups in our family were married—except Hubert. I always wanted to believe they were in love, but sometimes I heard them talk about the need for someone to take care of you when you get old, for someone to be with you so you’d never be lonely. I hated that! It sounded like a weird form of insurance—spouse as caretaker! I was sure the grown-ups were wrong. Prince Charming didn’t marry Cinderella because she looked like a good nurse!

I tried to argue with them once, but Cousin Jolene said, “It jest ain’t natural. Even God thinks so! He made Eve for Adam, didn’t He?”

So the family talked it over and decided Hubert needed at least one night of excitement, and who knew, he might meet the woman of his dreams. The grown-ups decided that the Elks Lodge Spring Dance was the ticket. Aunt Betty and Uncle Ray talked Hubert into going. He’d never been to a dance, and I think the homemade beer they’d drunk helped him say he’d go. Hubert might have regretted saying yes, but he didn’t back out. Aunt Betty took him shopping in preparation. He bought a real nice blue suit and dress shoes.

Uncle Ray made a run over to Newport to get some rum and whiskey for the special occasion. We lived in a dry county—that’s why Hubert made his own beer, not moonshine. He couldn’t see any sense in buying what he could make himself.

Hubert combed his hair til it shone like molasses in the lantern light. He had on his new suit and tie. He’d shined the already shiny dress shoes, and he glowed with quiet excitement, like a shy girl asked to dance by the most popular boy. Some of us thought this might be Hubert’s magical night, especially me. I thought of Hubert as a condemned man who could be saved by the right woman. I wanted to see Cinderella come to life with Hubert as the hero. I was young enough to believe in the magic of romance. Like a blender full of metaphors, I tried to grab just the right image for my thoughts. It was 1983, and he was too old for young love. But we hoped for him because we thought it would be nice for him to have a wife, even if it was too late for kids. It saddened me to think of Hubert living alone, no one there to talk or listen to. The thought of him aging and dying alone…

Uncle Ray hadn’t left anything to chance. He knew Hubert was too shy to ask a woman to dance, so he’d talked to a certain woman beforehand. She was about Hubert’s age, a pretty woman.

Uncle Ray said, “She’s the perfect choice. She’s known lots of men, if you get my drift, so she’ll know what do to.” Of course, Aunt Betty was appalled.

“Just what the Sam Hell are you thinking?!? You can’t just go fix Hubert up with some old hussy! This is supposed to be a nice evening for him. We are not, do you hear me—not, out to get him laid, especially by some woman who’s had half the men in county!”

Uncle Ray just grinned and explained, “Whoa now! I did not fix him up with some tramp. I just asked her to come over and ask him to dance—that’s all! Now, if the old boy gets lucky, well, who am I to tell him no?!”

Uncle Ray loves to tease, and after Aunt Betty peered into his eyes like a lie detector, she relaxed.

“Alright, Ray, we’ll do it yor way. But I’m tellin you now that if I find out she’s a floozy—boy, are you gonna get it!”

Actually, it’s a good thing Uncle Ray made those arrangements because Hubert sat at the table smiling, making no move to ask anyone to dance, not even Aunt Betty. He appeared to be having a good time watching people dance. Then the lady, Imogene, came over to him.

Imogene was a couple of inches shorter than Hubert. She was dressed in a floral print dress that looked like a swirling flower garden when she danced. Her blonde hair was curled and sprayed into place, and her makeup was just right. Since she didn’t look cheap, Aunt Betty relaxed. Uncle Ray introduced her as an old friend, which he had to explain to my aunt later.

Imogene spoke like everyone thinks a real southern woman should, softly, when she asked, “Hubert, would ya dance with me?”

A country and western band, hired for the evening, was playing a nice ballad.

Hubert smiled and said, “Why shor I would.”

Imogene softly took his hand and led him to the postage stamp dance floor. She found a spot for them and turned so Hubert could take her in his arms. He’d been watching the dancers all night so he knew one of his hands was supposed to be in the small of her back. But he wasn’t sure what to do with his other hand. For a moment or two he stood confused. Then he put his hand softly on her breast. The Elks Lodge had never before experienced such a full moment! People were silent like they’d been swaddled in cotton. The band members, who swore they’d seen it all, were still like they’d unexpectedly seen God, and He was black. There was a collective held breath while folks waited for Imogene’s reaction. Questions hovered in the air, humming like cicadas.

Some of the women, the ones who wondered if Imogene knew their husbands, smiled maliciously. If they’d spoken, their words would’ve wrapped Imogene in barbed wire. Most of the women hoped Imogene would display the grace she’d been known for as a young woman. The men fought the urge to laugh—like teenage virgins they couldn’t help staring as they remembered trying to do what Hubert was doing.

Imogene was still as she looked at Hubert. Fleetingly, she wondered if he’d been put up to this stunt. But as she looked into Hubert’s eyes, her body relaxed. His questioning look let Imogene know he wasn’t playing dumb just to get a feel. She smiled and took his hand off of her breast and just held it.

“I think this’ll be more comfortable,” she said as they began to sway with the other dancers.

As Hubert relaxed into the dance, Aunt Betty and Uncle Ray were recovering from their shock.

Aunt Betty said, “Well, didn’t you tell him or show him how to dance? Good Lord! You know he’s never been.”

Uncle Ray, eyes wide like a hoot owl’s, said, “Jesus, I never thought! God, I’m glad Imogene didn’t slap him!”

“Well, Raymond Eugene, if anybody needs slapped, it’s you! You said it was under control, you said don’t worry, you said I should butt out of men’s business! My God, the whole town’ll be talkin bout this tomorra! How’m I s’posed to go shoppin, go to work? Well? Just as I thought! You’ve got no answer! All you can do is laugh!”

It took a week for Aunt Betty to get all the gossip. She was right, the whole county talked about what came to be known as Hubert’s Waltz. Luckily for Uncle Ray, no one taunted Aunt Betty with it. Hubert was well thought of, so people talked gently about his gaffe as if he were their favorite cousin.

Hubert talked often of the dance, well often for Hubert. No romance developed between him and Imogene, which left me disappointed. But Hubert always referred to her as “quite a lady.” Everyone was always careful not to let him find out that Imogene had been quite a busy lady. Sometimes I’d hear him humming the song they’d danced to as he worked his fields, a smile hovering on his lips like a butterfly. He didn’t want to go to any more dances, though. It seemed that one was enough for him—at least that’s what he told me when I asked him.

“Suzy-Q, I’m mighty glad I went, it was interestin. I can see how some folks can get het up bout goin reg’lar. That Imogene, she was quite a lady, gentle and free as a hummin bird.”

His face softened like a sunset. I was sure he held the memory of Imogene carefully so it would last.

Hubert kept the suit and dress shoes. He had a stroke working out in the fields about five years later, and the dancing suit became his shroud. When Mom told me Hubert had died, I cried. I thought about Hubert dying with nothing more than a mule and a plow to say good-bye to him. But as I wept, I saw the same harvest moon smile on his face. And I realized Hubert had never been alone. I’d never seen the angels. But I bet they were always there.
