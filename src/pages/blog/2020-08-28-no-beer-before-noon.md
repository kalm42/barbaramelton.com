**Imagine it. There I stood, smiling beneath my mask.** The cashier, her hand resting comfortably on the six-pack of beer that was part of my grocery order. I smiled because I thought this cashier was being sweet and asking for my ID. I was ready to thank her for the lovely compliment. It dawned on me that she was still talking. Much slower this time. Being sure to enunciate. And her body language yelled out how wrong my reaction had been.



I try to be friendly with cashiers because I’ve been one. Not a lot that is worse than a day filled with silent or annoyed customers who move past you as if you’re part of the furnishings. This cashier and I had been enjoying chit-chat, friendly sounds that perfumed the air. About the same as my five foot and a bit height, she was also White. Her skin had that indoor whiteness that testifies to many hours working, far fewer playing in the sun. Her honey brown hair was wound into a bun on her head. Her face, above her mask, was devoid of makeup. Her lively brown eyes were now closed and “professional” as she stared at me and repeated herself.



“I’m sorry. This is Sunday. It is illegal for me to sell any alcohol or beer or wine to anyone before noon.”



No more smiling under my mask. Nope. Now my mouth was open in surprise!



“Oh my goodness! You’re serious! I thought you were teasing, and I was ready to laugh!”



The cashier visibly relaxed.



She looked over her left shoulder at the large clock high on the wall. It was barely 11:00 am.



“So did you want to…?”



Then it hit me. Not only is it against the law to buy booze--any booze--on Sunday before noon, I have to choose what I’m going to do with this poor little six-pack of beer. Laughter bubbled out through my mask!



“Oh you can keep the beer. Not that you aren’t great company, but I don’t plan to hang out here for an hour just so I can buy some beer.”



Her body relaxed, shoulders no longer touching her earlobes. I think she thanked me for not being upset. I was lost in thoughts, some of which escaped my mouth!



“I’m from California where pretty much everything is legal. And can be purchased whenever the store is open. I do like that! I guess here in Texas I’ll have to be more aware of how much beer is in the fridge! None of that last-minute run for beer stuff!”



The cashier and I shared a laugh at my reactions. And I left for home, sans beer.



**Epilogue**



Okay, this brief personal essay doesn’t need an “epilogue.” But I’m unsure what else to call these random thoughts. And I want to share them with you!



I can’t help but imagine what the employee training for this particular issue might include:

* Mandatory cashier training
* “How to Handle Sunday Booze Buyers”
* * Establish rapport with the customer
  * Maintain possession of the beer and/or wine
  * Explain the law does not permit you to sell the item(s)
  * Don’t miss the meeting! Important scenario-specific information will be given out.



I imagine cashiers want to say things like this:

* Think ahead, ya lush!
* Seriously, you’ve had a couple cases too many already. This law might be saving your life.
* Your accent says you’re from here. What is wrong with you?
* Yeah. Yeah. It’s a damn catastrophe. Everything in the world is just completely ruined forever and ever, world without end, because you are a poor planner. Let me get my violin.
* It’s 11:45 a.m. Just wait a few minutes. You could walk around for that long. Maybe you need some peanuts to go with this beer.
