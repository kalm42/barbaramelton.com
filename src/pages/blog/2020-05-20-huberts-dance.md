## [Hubert’s Dance](https://barbaramelton.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/huberts-dance/)

(Some of you will recognize this as “Hubert’s Waltz.” And you are right! I’ve revised it to some extent, owning it more fully as part of my story. My cousin continues to be an interesting man. I do not know that I have ever met any other human so comfortable in his or her own skin. I regret not knowing Hubert better. Too young to realize knowing the person and knowing the person through others’ stories are not the same. Too young to know it’s best to have both. Thus, my homage to Hubert through this story. I hope you enjoy it. I hope he would have.)

Hubert’s Dance

Part 1

“This road we’re on, this is graded. A good dirt road. Around here that means this is a city road because county roads are paved. It really is a good road, not too many bumps and it’s practically straight, only a couple of easy curves!”

Mom always explains what we see. Sometimes it helps me see more.

I’d asked earlier why we were going so slow. I wisely didn’t say it the way I thought it! Turns out, Mom wasn’t worried about speeding on dirt. She didn’t want folks thinking we were rude Californians. Thus, the turtle’s slow and steady speed. I’m not sure what Mom was worried about, though. The air was so heavy it weighed the dust down like a playground bully. Nothing stirred—not even insects could be heard.

I’d heard about humidity, and I’d lived in the South before. But I sure didn’t remember being able to see the air. It shimmers, by the way, just like in the movies. Beautiful. Feels opposite, though. I was just a girl when I lived in Texas and Missouri. Maybe little kids don’t notice the humidity. I’ve heard many adults say so.

Something happens when we hit ten. From there on out, it’s double digits or more. Once we have to use two digits to say our age, we notice things more. Good and bad. Shimmery air. And air thick and sticky like honey. Yards green as emeralds, gifts from the marriage of air and water. Skin never quite dry, always dewy fresh.

“Barbara Sue, it won’t help a damn thing for you to keep griping about how hot it is! Why don’t you look around you at all the beauty. I swear you’d miss an elephant you’re so busy complaining!”

Apparently, I’d said some or all of that aloud. Gotta be more careful about that! The edge on Mom’s voice was serious. She’d sliced right through the thickness, her words slamming into my ears. I knew she was miserable, too. She was sweating, and Mom never sweat. While I didn’t like it, I shut up.

She was right. We’d left California in a drought—everything brown except the pine trees and even those looked droopy. Here in Slapstone, Arkansas everything was green except the bushes next to the road—they had been conquered by the dust.

We were going to visit Mamaw. I’m still not real clear on how we’re related to her. I think she was married to someone’s great-grandpa. But maybe not. We hadn’t seen her in more than ten years. I was a baby last time she’d seen me. Mom said that Mamaw had cancer so us kids probably wouldn’t get to see her.

“You two would be too much for her,” Mom assured us.

I was glad because I imagined a shriveled, old woman barely making a dent in the feather bed. I didn’t want to have to hug someone so close to being a corpse. I didn’t say anything about this to Mom because I knew a series of lectures would follow. She’d remind me of our belief in God and how I shouldn’t be afraid of death.

She’d forget the stories she told me about taking dead people to the morgue when she worked at the hospital in Southern California. The one about her and another nurse discovering they were locked in the morgue when the corpse sat up—yes! That one is funny! Mom’s great at telling it! I was fine with funny story about corpses, fine with watching scary movies with my aunt. And I knew I might as well be fine with hearing Mom’s stories of her visits to Mamaw’s.

That’s how I knew Mamaw had a feather bed. That was one of Mom’s favorite stories. She told me lots of times that we had visited Mamaw when I was a baby. Mom, Mamaw, and I slept together in the feather bed, made by Mamaw and stuffed with feathers from her own geese. Mamaw told everybody in town she slept between her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter.

Mom said, “I was so embarrassed! You must remember, I was only eighteen years old, and the thought of everyone knowing I’d slept with my grandmother…well, it was awful. I kept telling Mamaw to quit telling everybody. But she just laughed.”

Then Mom laughed, every time, and said, “Oh, the silly things that embarrass us when we’re young!”

All of Mom’s stories have morals, and she just has to tell me what they are in case I don’t get it. Maybe in another life she was Aesop. I always wondered how Mamaw–or anyone–harvests geese feathers. Those creatures are vicious! Can’t see them giving up their feathers without a fight.

I figured I’d been quiet long enough for her to forget I’d been complaining, so I asked, “Mom, how come Mamaw lives so far out of town? If she’s sick, shouldn’t she be closer to town so somebody could take care of her?”

“Mamaw wants to stay in her own home. After all, she’s lived there for most of her ninety years. Besides, she’s not alone—Hubert lives with her.”

“Who’s Hubert?”

“Hubert’s one of Mamaw’s sons.”
