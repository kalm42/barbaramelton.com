**“Suzy, Aunt Cledith and Uncle GW** want you to spend the weekend with ‘em. Go get a bag packed up.”

“Ok, Mom.”

It’s almost always fun to be the only kid spending the weekend at a relative’s—I get to be the special one for two whole days. But I was kinda worried about this weekend with these relatives cause I didn’t really know either Aunt Cledith or Uncle GW well at all. In fact, I’d seen them less than a handful of times. And I was worried about what Aunt Cledith would do with me or to me.

I remember Mom telling me about a long ago visit to them.

“There I was, Suzy, feeling all grown up. And even if I was only 18, I was a Mom, so I thought that I’d be able to do as I pleased. Couldn’t have been more wrong! I was sitting on the front porch, relaxing in a pair of jeans and a comfy shirt, rollers in my hair, cigarette in my hand. Aunt Cledith opened the door, made a sound, and when the dust settled, I was in the bedroom, dress and slip in my hands.”

Mom always laughs after telling this bit of the story. I can only imagine what she is seeing in her mind’s eye. Did the cigarette fly from Mom’s hand into the gravel driveway? Did embers glow as if in mourning at Mom’s disappearance into the house? How long did Mom stand in the bedroom, staring confusedly at the dress and slip in her hands? When Mom laughed—and there is no doubt she did—was it quietly or loud enough for the neighbors to hear?

Mom says Aunt Cledith carried on something awful.

“All she could say to me the whole time was—“My word! What will the neighbors think!? You sittin on the porch with your hair in ROLLERS! AND smoking?? Ladies just do NOT do that!”

Well, that was fourteen years ago. But I was guessing that Aunt Cledith hadn’t changed too much. Jean shorts and a tank top probably wouldn’t be allowed. I’d had fun when we were out at their place. But being on my own with them, well, that’s just a whole different can of beans, as Mom would say.

Mom yelled from the living room, “Suzy, are you ready? What is taking so long? It’s just a weekend, and they live out in the country.”

When Mom walked into my room, she saw me sitting on my bed, surrounded by enough clothes to take care of me for a month of weekends.

As Mom laughed, I said, “Geez! Mom. I just don’t know what to wear? All I can think of right now is how Aunt Cledith didn’t even like you wearing jeans!! It’s summer and hot enough to fry the Devil. I want to wear shorts and tank tops. But I don’t want to be rude. And I really don’t want to be pushed into the bathroom and told to put on a dress and curl my hair and put on a bunch of make-up like I was some Southern Belle. What am I supposed to do?”

“Suzy, take your new sundress. It’s a dress, so if Aunt Cledith does want to take you somewhere, you can wear it. She said to tell you that shorts around the house would be fine.”

“Mom! I can’t believe you didn’t tell me this right away!”

Mom’s always telling me not to skip the details. I guess skiing over them like a bunny hill is acceptable. Then again, I wonder if this is one of those tricks Mom pulls every now and again—trying to show me how something she keeps telling me is important really is—important that is. Hmm. It’s clearer when she just tells me. But she hardly ever does it that way.

“Well, Sweetie, I just forgot.”

“Yeah. Forgot. Thanks for telling me whole minutes before my breakdown was complete.”

Hmph! When I say “forgot,” I hear the forgot-is-no-excuse lecture. Is this another Mom-thing, showing me how important “details” are and how “forgot” does lead to disaster? At least I think that’s what I remember from one of the lectures—the disaster thing. Or is forgetting just one more thing I can look forward to when I grow up? Just when I think growing up is a fantastic idea something happens that makes me wonder if I’m on the wrong track. Like when Mom shows pictures of herself when she was young and she looks so beautiful. In one picture she stands with her hand on her hip as if she’s daring the world to tell her she’s wrong—about anything. Her model’s figure is emphasized by her tight jeans and even tighter blouse. But always, before I can even utter the “wow” swelling in my chest, Mom laughs and tells me how time has washed away her girlish figure. If that’s what time does, I want off the time train.

As I finish packing, I wonder just how to avoid the time pitfall that swallowed Mom’s great figure and spat it out all chubby with star-burst stretch marks all across her belly. Mom’s voice pulls me back into the present as she tells me it’s time to go. Mom and I pile into the car to start the journey to Slapstone.

I don’t know who names the towns out here in Arkansas, but I think they’re drinkers. Maybe they’re sampling the moonshine I keep hearing about. I keep thinking I’ve gone through some kind of time warp or worm hole or some other science fiction time travel mechanism. I thought moonshine was a thing of the past—something that gangsters like Ma Barker and her Boys were involved in. But nope. Moonshine is being made—right now—in the 1970s.

Town names are mysterious, and not just in Arkansas. I thought Salida, California sounded pretty until someone told me “salida” means “exit” in Spanish. Why would people name their town “exit”? Did they think drivers would see the signs on the highway and feel commanded to “exit”—maybe spend some money in Salida after leaving the freeway? Maybe it’s one of those marketing strategies like my sociology teacher had talked about? Maybe that could explain Salida, California, maybe. But Slapstone, Arkansas? I just don’t see any marketing strategy in “slapstone.” Nope. I think it really is the moonshine.

But there are other differences between California and Arkansas. Not better or worse, just different. The other day in the grocery store I actually heard a lady say “Pshaw.” I stopped dead like I’d seen money on the floor and a movie star was pointing it out to me—I was that surprised. I thought “pshaw” was just a word in novels. Never in my life had I heard someone say the word—not until I was in a grocery store in Plowshare, Arkansas. And the woman said it like it was normal—no stiffness in her voice or body—she just said it the way I say “water.”

I was pulled out of my thoughts by a horn, being honked by none other than Aunt Cledith. She was pulling in as we were trying to leave.

“Jo, where are y’all headed? Did you forget that I was comin today?” yelled Aunt Cledith from the car.

Mom chuckled as she answered, “Oh my goodness! Sometimes I think I’d forget my head if it weren’t attached! Yes, Aunt Cledith, I did forget that you said you’d carry Suzy out to your place. I am glad for the saved trip, though! I’ve got to finish putting up those peaches we got from Shorty.”

Aunt Cledith grinned. She, like most folks in my family, likes to help out. Grabbing my overnight bag from the backseat, I jumped out of the car, hugged Mom bye, and got in with Aunt Cledith. I should have known better, though. No one in my family can just drive up, say hi, and then leave. No way. First, folks have to talk a bit, as Grandpa says.

Chatting finally over, I was still waving bye as Aunt Cledith shot out of the driveway like a bullet from a gun. Mom drives fast, so I wasn’t surprised or scared by the speed. But I was about to learn the difference between “lead foot” and “crazy driver.” We careened down the street, driving in the center lane—half of the right lane and half of the left. A guy I went to high school with was driving toward us—going the speed limit. As I turned in my seat, I saw his jeep swerve into the ditch and climb back onto the street. Turning back around, I found Aunt Cledith looking at me, shaking her head.

“Kids these days drive crazy! Did you see that boy? Drove right into the ditch just like he had good sense!!! Do you know him?”

I stared at Aunt Cledith, looking for a smile or sideways look, some sign that she was teasing. But nope. She was serious. I nodded my head. And then I swore to myself that it was the last time I’d do that in the car because Aunt Cledith was looking at me for an answer when she ran the lone stop sign in town. We missed the old man in the truck by a hair. He waved to us—with his middle finger—as we flew on by.

“Aunt Cledith, are we in a hurry to get home?”

“Well, no Suzy, we aren’t. Why do you ask?”

“Oh. No reason. Just wonderin.”

“Well, I thought we’d stop in town for dinner, drop by the Piggly Wiggly for a few things, and then head on home. Is there any shoppin you need to do?”

“No ma’am. Dinner does sound good, though. Where are we goin to eat?”

“Well, there’s a new place opened up on Main Street. Thought we’d try it out.”

Then I knew she meant Slapstone when she said town cause there was no new place in Batesville—not on Main anyway. I peeked at the speedometer. Aunt Cledith was trying for a new land speed record—must’ve been because we were going nearly ninety, and still in that special middle lane she’d carved out for us. We’d already left town far behind us. At least she wouldn’t be distracted by sale signs in store windows. I was pretty certain that Aunt Cledith was like Mom—always seing more scenery than anyone else in the car.

“You know, Suzy, the restaurant we’re goin to is owned by a cousin of ours.”

“Really? I didn’t know we had more relatives in Slapstone. I thought you and Uncle GW were the only people we were related to there.”

“Oh! my goodness, no! Suzy you are related to everyone in Slapstone!”

“Everyone? But Aunt Cledith. Well, that just isn’t possible. I can’t be related to an entire town!”

“Well, Suzy-Q—you are! By blood or marriage, you are related to everyone—and I mean EVERYONE—in Slapstone!”

I couldn’t breathe for a few seconds as Aunt Cledith’s news wrapped around me like an unwashed blanket. This just could not be true. It felt like one of those ugly Southern jokes I have heard too many tell. You know the ones—all about cousins marrying and stuff like that. If I were related to an entire town, it seemed to me that one or more of those jokes might have to be true!

“Aunt Cledith, are you teasing me?”

“No I am not! Why would I tease about family?”

I swallowed even though my mouth was dry, like swallowing clumps of sand. More than anything I wanted those jokes to be false, to be thought up by people who were jealous of Southern accents and decorative use of language, by folks Great-Great Grannie would call “damn Yankees.”

“But Aunt Cledith, I mean, well, wouldn’t they have to bring in new blood every now and then? If everyone in town is related, how does anyone get married? You can’t marry someone you’re related to!”

Aunt Cledith’s laugh hopped from her mouth and careened around the car, making my ears ring as they tried to block the high-pitched cacophony. Aunt Cledith’s laugh always made me want to duck my head.

“Suzy, weren’t you listening to me? I said “blood or marriage,” Girl! Of course, the folks who are related by blood do not marry each other! Cousin Bill Dee, who owns the restaurant we’ll be eating dinner at, married a real nice girl from Cushman. Her people are originally from Texas. But since she’s married to Bill Dee now, she’s one of your relatives—by marriage!”

My face glowed as red as a ripe strawberry but hot like a jalapeno—I was that embarrassed.

“Aunt Cledith, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to say our family would have cousins marrying cousins. I have just never heard of a person being related to an entire town!”

Aunt Cledith was still laughing, so hard that she began to cough. As she searched her purse for a tissue with one hand, her driving became even more frightening. We were still in the center of the highway, taking our share of the two-lane road right out of the middle. The car approaching us began to slow down. I could tell because I could hear the tires squealing as the driver hit his brakes. The driver’s eyes were wide and his head swiveled like a hoot owl’s as he continued staring at us as we passed.

That’s when I heard the siren.

I looked over my shoulder, and there behind us was a State Trooper’s car, lights flashing and siren blaring. Aunt Cledith had found the tissue and was wiping the tears of laughter from her eyes, still chuckling. She seemed unaware of the noisy cop behind us.

“Aunt Cledith, I think that Trooper wants us to pull over.”

“Oh Suzy, don’t be silly. He just wants to pull around me and is putting his siren on to let me know that.”

At fourteen, I’ve had enough grown-ups tell me not tell them how to drive because I was just a kid—with no license. But I’ve been in the car plenty of times when Mom was pulled over for speeding. Every time a cop was behind us with lights and/or siren going, it was to pull us over. Not once was it to signal that we were going to be passed.

“Maybe that’s how Arkansas State Troopers do it,” I thought.

But then I remembered that Mom had been pulled over just last week—by a State Trooper. His lights and siren had meant the same thing that a California Highway Patrol’s meant—pull over!

I sat with my hands folded in my lap, searching for a way to convince Aunt Cledith that she should pull over. If we didn’t pull over, what would happen? Would the Trooper shoot at us? Maybe he thinks we’re criminals. Maybe criminals look like grandmothers who bake cookies each week for their grandchildren.

“Pull your car over now!” boomed a male voice.

I thought maybe it was God! But nope. The Trooper did it.

Aunt Cledith gasped like a teenage girl at a horror movie. One hand flew to her throat while the other gripped the steering wheel.

“Well my lands!” whispered Aunt Cledith.

She steered back into the lane she should have been driving in and stopped the car, putting it in “park.” She pushed the button that lowered her window and turned, ready to talk to the Trooper.

I looked over my shoulder, watching the Trooper approach the car. He was tall like my uncle—a little over six feet. He also looked young enough for me to have a crush on him, and he was quite handsome! He adjusted his gun belt and hat as he walked from his car to ours. He leaned down to speak.

“Ma’am, I’ll need to see your license and registration please.”

“David Wayne, is that you under that hat?” Aunt Cledith asked.

“Why Miz Evans, yes, ma’am it is.”

He tipped his hat in greeting. Watching him do so made me feel like I was in one of those Westerns that Dad always watches. All the men in those movies are always tipping their hats—to say “howdy,” to say “yor nice lookin,” to warn bad guys to “get outta town.”

Aunt Cledith surprised the Trooper then. And me.

“Well, David Wayne, I’ve half a mind to call yor Momma when I get home! Just what do you think yor about, yelling at me through that loud speaker that way! You almost made me wreck the car! And here I’ve got GW’s niece in the car with me. Just how would I explain a car accident to her folks? Huh? Well? What have you to say for yourself, Young Man?”

Because Aunt Cledith was facing Trooper David Wayne, I couldn’t look at her face and see if she was teasing. Her tone of voice reminded me of Mom’s right before I got grounded. So I felt pretty sure Aunt Cledith was serious. But even I knew we weren’t supposed to drive in the middle of the road.

Trooper David Wayne cleared his throat and said, “Miz Evans, I mean no disrespect. But do you realize you were driving in the middle of the road? That is very dangerous. And you were driving about 75 miles per hour. But the speed limit on this road is 55.”

Aunt Cledith had her door open and was out before I could even breathe. She was about as old as Grannie, who was 65. But Aunt Cledith got out of her car faster than a kid sliding down a stair rail. Trooper David Wayne took a couple steps back, hand on his gun. I held my breath and tried to be invisible. She looked up at him, her finger in his face, as she began to talk.

“David Wayne I cannot b’lieve you would have the aw-dacity to imply that I was not driving right! I happen to know the contractor who built this here road—just as well as you do. And we both know that cantankerous old billy goat made the lanes too narrow to drive in just so’s he could make a fistful of dollars more! If I were thick headed enough to put my car any closer to the right, GW’s niece and I would be sittin in that ditch over there. And wouldn’t that be a kettle fish disaster? And to even whisper that I was speeding? SPEEDING? You know’s well as anyone that I do not drive fast! No LADY does that!”

I was breathing again—quickly because I was doing my best not to laugh right out loud. I have one Grandmother who is forever teaching me how to be a LADY. So I thought I’d heard all of the definitions. But I was wrong. According to what Aunt Cledith was saying, being lady-like means you do not speed. I had one hand covering my mouth to stifle the giggles that were bubbling up like a brook in my throat as I tried to picture some “loose” woman speeding. Of course, all the “ladies” would stop on the sidewalk and stare and point at the female-driven speeding car, whispering among themselves “That woman is no lady!” I guess Aunt Cledith had never seen an episode of Charlie’s Angels!

Poor Trooper David Wayne stood in front of Aunt Cledith like a school boy caught with both hands—dirty hands, no less—in the cookie jar and chocolate on his lips. He tried to explain to Aunt Cledith what his job was.

“Miz Evans, yes, I do know who built this road. But really Miz Evans, the lanes are standard width. You can safely drive in the lane without putting two tires in the ditch. Truly.”

Aunt Cledith cut him off before he made another sound—much less got another whole word out. The gun in his belt didn’t scare her.

“David Wayne I cannot even count how many times I’ve carried you to school and to ball games and to school dances. Now do you think yor Momma and Daddy would have let me do that if I were a bad driver? A speeder?”

Aunt Cledith, like any Mom in the middle of a lecture, went right on talking, giving him no chance to reply.

“That’s right. They wouldn’t. You spent half yor weekends at our house as you were growin up! You and our Tommy Lee were always up to somethin. And now here you stand in yor shiny uniform tryin to tell me that I am not a LADY behind the wheel! Well you’d better just think again young man!”

Aunt Cledith actually pushed his chest a little to punctuate her last sentence. I quit laughing, afraid that she was going to jail. I didn’t know if it was illegal to yell at a cop, but I was pretty sure you weren’t supposed to touch them in any way. My last giggle dissolved faster than any dried up brook—dying like my breath was doing again.

Trooper David Wayne took his hat off, bowed his head, shook it ever so slightly and began to apologize.

“Miz Evans, yes ma’am, you’re right. Tommy and I were best buds in junior high and high school. And I thought of y’all’s home as my second one. I am truly sorry Miz Evans to have upset you like this. Please just be real careful on this road—promise me now.”

Aunt Cledith patted his arm, smiled, and said, “Well, of course I will David Wayne. I just knew there was a good reason for you to be pullin me over. And here it is. You were just lookin out for me like the good boy you are.”

She beamed with pride as she patted his arm again, urging him to call and come by for a visit real soon, promising him a piece of homemade cherry pie. As he walked back to his car, Aunt Cledith reminded him to tell his Momma and Daddy hi from her.

I sat silent as Aunt Cledith got back in the car, put the car in gear, and shot down the middle of the road.
