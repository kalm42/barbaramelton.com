**Easy** **to** **see** **from** my pictures that I move through the world as a White American woman. In many ways, “Cledith Driving” is a story of White Privilege. What isn’t so easy to see is how my family is also representative of why I know the damn necessity of saying “Black Lives Matter, Brown Lives Matter.”

My great aunt, the woman who inspired me to write “Cledith,” was my grandpa’s sister-in-law. Well, she would’ve been if Grandpa had not been killed in WWII. Grandpa was tall and fair—what’s the line from that song “six foot two, eyes of blue”? Uncle “GW” was medium height with brown hair and eyes and skin. Yes. Skin.

Great Grandma, mother of my grandpa and Uncle “GW,” was American Indian, much darker than her White American husband. Check out the family photo above. I love this picture of the family that created my grandpa. And I remember the first time I saw it. I was thirteen years old. (For those who need documentation, sorry. Don’t have any. I’m floating on family lore here. I realize that may be wrong. Perhaps Great Grandma had a different ethnicity. It matters not to my point. And I like the family stories.)

I held the photograph in my hand and whispered, “I knew it. I knew we were related to Black people.”

And a montage of memories drifted in and out of my consciousness:

* A multitude of visuals as I heard “You think nobody got into the woodpile? Look at Barbara’s butt!” Always followed by lots of laughter. Or the questions I peppered Mom with after a few family picnics: “Cousin \_\\_\_ said only—he used the ”N” word Mom! He said only Black people like watermelon. But how can that be true? I love watermelon. And what does Uncle ___ mean when he talks about a wood pile and my butt? Why does everyone laugh?“
* Images of Mom’s face, angry with unshed tears, as she told me about being called a “dirty Indian.”
* My step-aunt and I, five and four years respectively, staring into the bureau mirror: Me mashing my nose as flat as possible. Her trying to keep the clothespin on her nose even though it hurt so much. Tears running down her face. The neighbor lady, iron gray hair all shiny in the sun, smiling with her mouth when she told us what to do.
* * “I know you want a pretty nose like hers. You can get one! Just put a clothespin on your nose. If you hold it there for a while, when you take it off, your nose will stay up. Won’t be flat any longer.”
  * When Mom found us, she said both our noses were just fine. My step aunt’s eyes said she no longer believed that line. We three were sad together for a moment. I still feel the shadow of that moment.
  * The neighbor’s mouth smiled when she said these words. Her eyes were hard like marbles, though. My step aunt is the biological daughter of an American soldier and a Korean woman who loved her so much she gave her up for adoption. When my step grandmother adopted this beautiful child, she became part of the tapestry of our family. Both her beauty and her different color made her a target in the small Northern California city we lived in. I hated most when the adults said racist things to her. Neither she nor I could defend against that attack because we were taught to respect our elders.

Such a damn Gordian knot.

And in this way, my family and I are representative of how complex America’s racism issues are. We are literally more colorful. And I have many relatives who are racist and do not appreciate change. Some conversations are happening that are challenging. Some family members will not see that “Cledith Driving” is an example of White Privilege. But many people will see the story that way. Both ways of reading/interpreting the story are true.

Most of us know White Privilege is wrong, that it’s based on hundreds of years of racism, and that it needs to stop. And if it were easy to dismantle such bullshit, Americans would have done it by now. I hope we are strong enough to look at our history because that is what has created our present. No pretending. We need to look at everything —good, bad, and in-between. We cannot move closer to our ideals of equality for all if we do not first acknowledge our whole history. All of it. Not just the shit that makes us swell with pride. 

The subject isn’t easy. Many families’ stories are complex. Consider this part of my family story: When Uncle “GW” returned from WWII, he and his best friend, a Black American man, went into business together. They were doing well. Until the local KKK chapter shut them down. Luckily, both my uncle and his partner/best friend were warned in enough time to literally escape town with their lives. Sadly, it was decades before these men knew if the other had also escaped. Imagine going decades wondering if your best friend had escaped death? Their business was burned down. Neither man was financially compensated. Another example of American racism.

My great aunt inspired me to write “Cledith Driving” because she was spunky and brave and caring. She came from poverty, working her way toward a better financial life. She reached back to help others along her way. She said that was the way we were all supposed to live. She had her quirks and faults, of course, but she always tried, never stopped. She and my great uncle didn’t just talk about equality—they lived it. I love telling family stories. They communicate who my people are, where I come from. And perhaps more importantly, they help me see in what direction I need to grow.
