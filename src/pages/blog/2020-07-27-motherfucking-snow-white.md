### Living in North Texas has changed how I exercise. Seems like such a trivial sentence. A throw away thought. One of those things ya toss into a conversational lull—perhaps someone will pick up the topic like a wadded piece of paper from the sidewalk. But I don’t say it like that. I mean the humidity is stifling to me—a Californian. Stalling much past 9 a.m. means no walk for me that day. And I’m not a fan of “no walk for me.” Walking is my exercise for body, soul, and mind. Missing the walk is akin to missing water—for a whole day.

Thus, I’m out, feet slapping a steady rhythm on the sidewalk, early. The need to walk and the loving support I receive for doing it keep me motivated. I dress myself for the walk, ironically thanking the Universe for sparsely populated streets—less time in the mask when I’m plowing through hot, humid North Texas air is a blessing! And I walk at least two miles, returning home sweaty and triumphant. And in that moment, brain awash in endorphins, I am happy with how I’ve adapted to my environment.

Last week was particularly hot, official ‘heat warning’ kinda weather. Tuesday morning, though, my walk began as usual around 9 a.m. Hair pulled back, hat on, sunscreen-ed, water in hand I headed out. I’d been wrestling with decisions. Prayers had been answered, I thought. I moved forward with confidence until I was plagued with self-doubt.

Echoing in my mind, “What if you’re wrong? What if your ego is talking so loudly you can’t hear your Angels?”

Leaving the house loaded with self-doubt, frustration, fear, and a large dose of the grouchies, I still began my walk with a look at the big Texas sky—the beginning of my walking prayer.

I’d love to say that my walks are quiet, introspective moments communing with the Universe. But those who know me are laughing and shaking their heads at the mere notion! My prayer walks are better described as conversations.

Tuesday’s conversation began with my heart-shaped sunglasses clad face looking heavenward while I said, “Okay, I’m pretty sure You said yes to my prayer. But I’m a puny, flawed human. I coulda gotten that whole thing wrong. Please. Send a sign that a puny human can understand. Send something that even a dizzy, dumb blonde type could not misunderstand. Yes. Please. An answer THAT clear. Thank you.”

As I picked up my pace, I heard a new refrain. Gone was “What if you’re wrong.”

Now all I could hear was “Look up! Look up!”

As I looked up, I said sarcastically, “Really? That’s what you have for me? ‘Look up.’ Okay. Literally do it because I’m about to walk into a tree? Or oncoming traffic? Should I hear this as ‘things are lookin up’?”

I continued walking, now talking myself into listening, “Seriously, Barb. You asked for clarity. And immediately your Angels are talking to you. And your response is to be pouty? Yes, the words are open to interpretation. Maybe that’s the message. Maybe, Barbara, you have to choose to listen or to pout.”

Hated that I’d made such a damn good point. Really, sometimes I am just a little too—right.

At the stop light, I said, “Okay. I’m lookin up. I’m sorry for being such a grouchy bitch. You know it’s part of my process, though. Hahaha! I do want to hear my message. I’m open. I’m lookin up. What do you want me to see?”

From nowhere, a bird perched on the street sign, stared at me until I stared back, sang two notes, and flew to my right.

“Okay. I’ll go right.”

My walk was now an adventure! I was on a street I’d never been on before. But I’d agreed to be led on this walk, so I knew all would be well. I had no idea how often I look down when I’m walking! A few steps onto this new street finds the refrain “Look up! Look up” echoing in my mind again.

I looked up to see three dragonflies dancing before me. Looping-the-loops, weaving in and out, creating an ethereal tapestry. I know I gasped aloud at the beauty. I may have also clapped. And I walked on.

At the next intersection, I said, “Okay. Which way?”

A different bird flew in from over my right shoulder, so close I could feel a breeze. He perched on the stop sign across the street, cocked his head, and stared at me. When I reached the center of the intersection, he flew away. At the next intersection, another bird flew in to show me the way. And again, I followed, trying to look up.

I know I was looking down because I saw the butterfly enter my Core Star, near my heart chakra. Yes. Into me. And out again. Playful, this butterfly. Thankfully, breathing is automatic. I know I continued walking, did not break my pace. And I know that for several moments I was spiritually somewhere else, guided by a beautiful butterfly.

Images flooded my mind. Laughing faces. Flowers. Trees. Tire swings. Faces of loved ones. Dollar signs. Ampersands. A lake or pond. Home. Office. Airplane. Boat. Sounds of laughter, wind in trees, the slap of waves on a boat, soft sighs of love, drums like heartbeats, butterfly giggles that float like bubbles in the air. The scent of sea air, my infant son, a rose, that spot behind his left ear, fir trees.

Somehow I was at another intersection. And another bird was showing me the way. And suddenly I was self-conscious, trying to breathe through the amazing messages flooding all my senses. So many reasons to look up, to believe, to trust, to hope, to love.

As I turned left onto Peak Street, I laughingly said, “Yep. Like motherfucking Snow White being led by the friendly creatures of the forest.”

And that’s when I understood. Three birds flew in, perched on the roof of the house I stood in front of. Two hungry cats had run to greet me as if I were an old friend. As I stooped to pet their skinny frames, I looked at the house. Someone still lived there. Someone loved these cats—Cat Condo on the front porch taking up more room than the chair for the human. Pretty food dishes in their appointed places, speaking to better times. I don’t know who lives here, but I can imagine the pandemic forcing painful choices like whom to feed.

Petting the cats, I said to them, “I must walk home so I can get in my car and buy some food for you. I have enough to help. I promise I’ll be back.”

As I walked home, I looked up and said, “Thank you. Thank you.”

When I returned with the cat food, the kitties chewed on, perhaps agreeing with my new found wisdom: That fucking Snow White knew some serious shit.
