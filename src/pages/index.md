    Her granddaughter entered the sparsely furnished apartment. She saw her
    grandmother working on a jigsaw puzzle, the card table pulled close to the
    recliner. Perched excitedly on the edge of the recliner was Granny, smiling
    and holding her arms out for a hug. 


    "You were gone so long this time, Sweetie. I near gave up hope of seein my first-born granddaughter again."


    As the granddaughter leaned in for a hug, her eyes fell on the framed 8x10 glossy picture in the ornate frame. 


    Granny cackled with humor, "Yep! Still got the picture of the family that ought to be mine!"


    Her granddaughter's eyes, so filled with love a moment ago, transformed, fill with clouds hiding truth from everyone, even herself. 


    "Of course, you do Granny. Maybe you should write that soap opera and invite the cast for Christmas. Maybe they'll come."


    Granny, wrapped in her granddaughter's arms, smiled with pleasure at this echo of her greatest wish. She neither heard nor saw the pain as again this first-born grandchild learned again that she was not enough. Just not enough.

    She looks up at a clear blue sky, the kind of sight that makes ya whisper "Texas."

    She smiled, "Gonna be a good day! Nothin up there but clouds and bird farts."

    I saw the wind blow a leaf into the cemetery. The leaf fought valiantly throughout this last leg of its journey, following the poet's advice. Twisting this way and that in the wind, maybe it couldn't allow itself to submit. I think it was surprised at the gentle landing.

    I sat on the beach. scooping sand into my hand, watching it flow through my fingers. Few people about. The rhythm of the ocean combined with my scooping of the sand. I concentrated on the sand as it fell back to earth, flowing like water through my fingers. Lost in thought....this sand looks like microscopic pieces of seashells, like a living carpet testifying to the power of erosion and time. What else did it take to transform the seashells into sand? What did that feel like to become something so different?
