  title: Fresh Writing!
  description: >
    Texas rain is so serious compared to California rain. Water falls from the
    sky in CA, when it feels like it, kinda like a bratty teen offering just
    enough parental contact to keep those adults calmed down. Rain in Texas
    pours from the sky by turns eager to reach Mother Earth like excited
    toddlers and pummeling the same Mother Earth with raindrops like angry
    toddlers stomp their feet.

    talent... it's a calling.
