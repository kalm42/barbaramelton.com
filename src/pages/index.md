    I saw the wind blow a leaf into the cemetery. The leaf fought valiantly throughout this last leg of its journey, following the poet's advice. Twisting this way and that in the wind, maybe it couldn't allow itself to submit. I think it was surprised at the gentle landing.

    I sat on the beach. scooping sand into my hand, watching it flow through my fingers. Few people about. The rhythm of the ocean combined with my scooping of the sand. I concentrated on the sand as it fell back to earth, flowing like water through my fingers. Lost in thought....this sand looks like microscopic pieces of seashells, like a living carpet testifying to the power of erosion and time. What else did it take to transform the seashells into sand? What did that feel like to become something so different?
