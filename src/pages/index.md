  title: A sudden burst of love...
  description: >2
     There I sat, a pause in grading to refresh my mind. An episode of “Community” played on the TV like background music. I gathered materials, ready to work on one of my current craft projects. Kaleidoscopic thoughts flitted through my mind—noteworthy examples of student writing, the interesting play of light across the variations of pink in this current project, ideas circling for the next project, revision ideas for “Mrs. Stinky.” I felt my shoulders relax as I made a mental note to remember to do Pilates later. And somehow I was suddenly overcome with love. A golden light embraced me with such tenderness and joy. I turned my head, looking for you. I wanted nothing more in that moment than to find you and hug you close as I showered you with kisses, to say “love you!”
